# Brewfile
My Brewfile for managing installed programs

## Getting Started

To get started, just run the setup script:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquacode/Brewfile/main/guided-install.sh)
```


Alternatively, you can just download the [`Brewfile`](https://github.com/aquacode/Brewfile/blob/main/Brewfile) to `~/.Brewfile`, make any desired changes, then run `brew bundle --global` to install the listed packages.
